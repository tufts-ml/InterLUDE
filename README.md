# InterLUDE
This is the code for paper InterLUDE. 

To run the code, you can either go directly to the corresponding folder and run the python files.

Another way to run the code is using a bash file to pass in the hyperparameter settings. (Example bash files are provided in runs/ folder, you will need to modify the paths to point to the data/the folder you want to store the output/the path to your script etc. The examples are based on CNN experiments, for ViT experiments you can adapt them correspondingly.)


More polihsed codebase will be make public before the conference date.
